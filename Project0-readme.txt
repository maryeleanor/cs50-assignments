Frogger-like game for Scratch

Upload and play on MIT's Scratch platform: https://scratch.mit.edu/

Like the old video game frogger, use the arrow keys to move the beetle up the screen / across the road.
You win when you reach the top of the screen successfully.
The game should then reset in about 10 seconds.
